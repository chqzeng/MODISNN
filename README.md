# MODISNN
## About
From MODIS bands, use nueral network(NN) to predict MERIS/OLCI bands for chlorophyll-a concnetration modelling 

This repository is the implementation of the following publication:
[Zeng,C. and Binding,C. Consistent Multi-Mission Measures of Inland Water Algal Bloom Spatial Extent Using MERIS, MODIS and OLCI. 2021. Remote Sensing 13(17):3349. DOI: 10.3390/rs13173349.](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/17/3349)

## Usage
The package can be cloned into a directory with:
`git clone https://github.com/chqzeng/MODISNN`
or you can manually download this repository and unzip to a local directory

and then run the MODISNN in one of the following two approaches:
### 1. input spectra as a table

### 2. input spectra as an image
